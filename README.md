# Readme

Last updated on 8th August 2020</br>
<b>Theme Traveller: Tabletop RPG Software</b> is being developed in the <b><i>Unity Game Engine</i></b>

# Introduction

Hi and welcome to the Theme Traveller: Tabletop RPG Software Readme File.</br> 
This space will also serve as the software’s design document. 

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop games and software with an open source license that’s available for the world to download and enjoy with the benefits of the user being able to modify it however they see fit. The first addition to this project will be a set of tools that can be used to run a digital tabletop RPG game. The user will be able to create custom rules and world settings then have other players join the game session and run encounters for those players.

# Development Team

Let's meet them all :)

<b>Bio:</b> Anton is obsessed with critical deconstruction of game design. He notices flaws and tries to think of ways to implement better systems. As a child he was enthralled by video game systems like the NES, SNES, N64 and GameCube. His favorite game franchise is The Legend of Zelda. Today he plays a myriad games across many platforms and he’s quickly become disappointed with the design philosophy of the biggest, most profitable game developers and publishers in the world. His mission is to recruit and organise a group of people with similar interests who will create games and software that better suit their audiences.

# Contact Us

To all interested parties,

I welcome anyone else who sees value in what we're creating to also join our community and help with this collaborative process. You do not need any prior experience in software development to be part of the team, I have little to none myself and I'm learning as I progress through various web apps and online services such as <i>Udemy</i>, <i>Codecademy</i>, <i>Coursera</i>, <i>Youtube</i> and <i>GitHub</i>. This software is being developed using the <i>Unity Game Engine</i>, assets are created with <i>Blender</i>, <i>Gimp</i> and <i>Paint.net</i>, the code editing is done in <i>Visual Studio Code</i>. All of these tools are available to download and use for free. Please contact me if you'd like to get involved or even if it's just to say hi and you love what we're up to. Thanks for taking an intrest in our project.

Kindest regards, Anton Zumpe</br>
